# ClusteringCrypto
---
- Use unsupervised learning to help investors make better decisions by generating reports of tradeable cryptocurrencies and classifying them by group. 
- Hvplot and plotly express were used for visualizations in the Clustering_Crypto file. 
- Altair is used for visualizations in the crypto_clustering_sm since it is compatiable with AWS SageMaker, which I later deployed this model on.
---
- Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.
- Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present results.
